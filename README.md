# Exploring-the-difference-between-ML-AND-DL-Classifiers-in-Distinguishing-Fake-from-Real-Images

The distinction between fake and real photographs is
 becoming increasingly significant in a variety of fields, including
 media forensics, journalism, and social media analysis. Because
 of the widespread use of modified and misleading visual content,
 robust solutions for distinguishing between true and manipulated
 images are required. Deep learning algorithms and machine
 learning classifiers have emerged as useful tools for solving this
 difficulty. These algorithms can effectively distinguish between
 true and fake images by exploiting a wide range of visual signals
 and learning complicated patterns. This research investigates
 the role of machine learning classifiers and deep learning in
 determining whether photos are real or fake. The paper explore
 the many methodologies and techniques used to train these
 models, such as machine learning classifiers, convolutional neural
 networks (CNNs), and pre-trained models and most of them.
 accomplished high peformance.



 The dataset used in this project consists of fake and real
 faces downloaded from Kaggle.The fake faces were already
 built with GAN, contains a wide range of synthetic images
 that resemble real-world items, enabling for analysis and ex
perimentation in the absence or addition to real data Moreover,
 presents a challenging task to classify them correctly, even for
 the human eye. The dataset’s real human faces were gathered
 to provide a fair representation of various characteristics
 as age, gender, makeup, ethnicity, and more that may be
 encountered in a production environment.The dataset contains
 a total of 2041 images, with 960 images labeled as ”Fake”
 faces and 1081 images labeled as ”Real” faces. The images
 are in RGB format.
